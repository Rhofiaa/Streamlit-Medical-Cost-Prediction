#### Insurance cost prediction
This repository contains the Medical Cost Personal Datasets project, which has been uploaded to kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance and aims to provide valuable information on medical costs for individuals. The datasets included in this project have been selected and collected from a variety of sources, ensuring a comprehensive and diverse representation of medical cost information. 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the factors that contribute to medical costs, such as age, gender, BMI, region and number of children. By examining these factors, we hope to better understand the underlying patterns and correlations that influence medical costs. 

In this repository, you'll find the datasets in CSV format, as well as a Jupyter notebook showing how to load, clean and analyze the data. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions and sample code to guide users through the process of exploring and visualizing the datasets.
